## Hey! My name is Nikita ðŸ˜„

I'm an Engineering Systems & Computing student at the University of Guelph, bringing a strong interest in project management, team leadership, and technical execution.

### **ðŸš€ What Drives Me?**
I enjoy building projects from the ground up. Not just writing code, but also planning, organizing, and leading cross-functional teams to turn ideas into working solutions. 

### **ðŸŒŸ Outside of School?**
When I'm not staring at a monitor, I enjoy working out, shopping, listening to music, and learning new hobbies. You'll never catch me bored!

**Thanks for stopping by, check out some of my projects below! ðŸ˜Ž**
