## Hey! My name is Nikita ðŸ˜„

I'm an Engineering Systems & Computing student at the University of Guelph, bringing a strong interest in project management, team leadership, and technical execution ðŸŒ¸

### **ðŸš€ What Drives Me?**
I enjoy building projects from the ground up. Not just writing code, but also planning, organizing, and leading cross-functional teams to turn ideas into working solutions ðŸŽ¯ 

### **ðŸŒŸ Outside of School?**
When I'm not staring at a monitor, you can catch me at the gym, taking a swim, impulsively shopping , or binging Netflix ðŸ¤«

#### Thanks for stopping by, check out some of my projects below! ðŸ˜Ž
